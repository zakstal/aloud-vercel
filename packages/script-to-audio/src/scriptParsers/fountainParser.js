const text = `INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
A bustling coffee shop filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the chatter of patrons. SARAH, a 30-year-old writer with messy hair and ink-stained fingers, sits at a corner table, furiously typing on her laptop.

JOHN, a handsome barista in his mid-20s, approaches with a steaming mug.

JOHN
Your usual, Sarah. Extra shot, no foam.

Sarah looks up, startled.

SARAH
Oh, thanks John. You're a lifesaver.

JOHN
(smiling)
No problem. How's the new novel coming along?

SARAH
(sighing)
Slowly. Very slowly. I think my characters are plotting against me.

JOHN
(laughs)
Well, if they stage a revolt, I've got your back. And plenty of caffeine.

Sarah grins and takes a sip of her coffee.

SARAH
You're officially my favorite person right now.

John winks and walks away. Sarah turns back to her laptop, a small smile playing on her lips as she begins to type again.

FADE OUT.
